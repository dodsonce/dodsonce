👋 Hi! My name is Clint Dodson and I am an aspiring software engineer. My current role is more on the sales side of things,
     with an emphasis on engineering support. A lot of the "engineering" I do, is more based on hardware.
     Specfically, board level components as I partner with manufacturers in the Greater Tampa Bay Area. I am gearing
     up to relocate to Asheville, NC. 
 👀 I’m interested in learning how to build apps and programs and improve processes for production for companies. In a non-professional
    way, I am interested in soccer, golf, cooking, hiking, and catching live music as much as I can. 
 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in the Triple Ten BootCamp. I have learned HTML and CSS, and am beginning JavaScript...
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project that can gave me real world experience. 
 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at clintdodson03@gmail or Discord: crabsurprise
